This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.


## Chapter 1: Setup

- `node -v`
- `npx -v`

- **Bun** : https://bun.com/
- A better javascript package manager, we can use instead of npx.

- Install Bun: curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

- Verify:    bun -v  or bunx -v

- We can create a nextjs app by  :  `npx create-next-app@latest`
 
- We can create a next-js app with bunx also like this.

    ```(base) ‚ûú  slack-clone bunx create-next-app@latest slack-tutorial

    Creating a new Next.js app in /Users/bhakti/projects/slack-clone/slack-tutorial.
    Using bun.```


- Open the folder in VS code.

- Install **tailwindcss intersense**, **Simple react snippet** , **errorlense**, **color highlight**   plugin to vs code.
 
- Install **shadcn UI**, https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation
    - This gives us all the UI components.

- Initialize shadcn in this project. Go to the project folder. https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next


- `bunx --bun shadcn@latest init`


- Add a button component from shandcn to our project. https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/button

- `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add button`

- This will add the button component to our project under src/components folder. This  gives full access to modify any property of that UI component.

 Now we can import Button component and use it as below.
- In page.tsx.

    ```import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
    export default function Home() {
    return (
    <Button variant="destructive" >Click me</Button>
    );
    }
    ```

##  Chapter 2- Auth Screens

### Global.css: 

- Next.js scaffolds a globals.css file to keep application-wide styles in one place. It is native to nextjs not a base react thing.
- It automatically imports this file in app/layout.tsx (or pages/_app.tsx if you‚Äôre on the Pages Router).
- This ensures your base styles (Tailwind, resets, fonts, etc.) are loaded once across the whole app.
- Tailwind requires you to import its base layers (@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;).
- Next.js puts those imports inside globals.css.
- You could technically put them in any CSS file, but globals.css is the convention.
- We can put any app wide global styling here.

### React Server component vs client component:
- **Server Component (default)**
 - Runs only on the server.
 - Can fetch data directly (no API needed).
 - Smaller bundle size (not sent to the browser).
 - No React hooks (like useState, useEffect).
- **Client Component ("use client";)**
 - Runs in the browser.
 - Can use React state, hooks, event listeners (onClick, etc.).
 - Must be explicitly marked with "use client"; at the top.

#### Rendering Location
- **Server Components**
- Rendered on the server (Node.js runtime, not in the browser).
- HTML is generated and sent to the client
- Never shipped as JS to the browser (lighter bundle).


- **Client Components**
- Rendered in the browser after hydration.
- Full React code is bundled, sent to the client, and executed there.


| Feature | Server Component | Client Component |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| useState, useEffect, useContext | ‚ùå Not allowed | ‚úÖ Allowed |
| Event handlers (onClick, onChange) | ‚ùå Not possible | ‚úÖ Possible |
| Access to backend/data (DB, FS, secrets) | ‚úÖ Yes (runs on server) | ‚ùå No (only via API) |
| Bundled to browser | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Can include Client Components | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ N/A |


#### Usage Scenarios
- **Server Component (default)**

- Fetch data directly from DB or API.
- Render static or dynamic UI that doesn‚Äôt need interactivity.
- Example: Blog post page, product list, navbar.

- **Client Component ("use client";)**

- Required for interactivity (buttons, forms, animations).
- Anything that needs hooks (useState, useEffect).
- Example: Dropdown menus, chat input box, counters.


### Understanding State:

#### What is useState?
- In React, components are just functions. Functions normally forget everything once they return.
 - But UI needs memory (e.g., whether a user is logged in, a counter value, etc.).
 - üëâ useState is React‚Äôs way to give a component private memory (state) that:
 - persists across re-renders
 - triggers re-rendering when updated
 - Think of it as a field inside an object, but scoped to a function.

#### Syntax:
- `const [state, setState] = useState("initialValue");`
 - This is array destructuring in JavaScript/TypeScript.
- useState returns an array with two things:
 - The current value of the state (state)
 - A function to update it (setState)
- Similar to 
  - ```
    const stateAndSetter = useState("signIn");
    const state = stateAndSetter[0];`
    const setState = stateAndSetter[1];
    ```
 - setState() method that not only changes the value but also notifies React to re-render the UI

#### Why not just use a variable?
 - `let state = "signIn";`
 - `state = "signUp"; // ‚ùå Won‚Äôt work in React, `
 -  When we define a state variable using useState method, it act as a state, which persists across rendering, when that variable is updated using setState, it notifies the react to re-render the component.

### shadcn ui components:
- Add few more shadcn components: `bunx --bun shadcn@latest add card input separator`
- Add react icon: `bun add react-icons`

### Interfaces and Defining component properties and component parameters:

#### In TypeScript, an interface describes the shape of an object.
- ``` 
  interface SignInCardprops{
    setState: (state: SignInFlow) => void
    }
  ```
Here, SignInCardProps means:
  - ```
    {
    setState: function that takes (state: SignInFlow) and returns nothing
     }
     ```
#### Then Suppose my component taking this interface as a param
- ```
    export const SignInCard = ({setState} : SignInCardprops) =>{}
    ```
- means destructing, it is taking setState from the input object.
- Then where we are using this component we need to pass these param of that interface.
- ``` 
    const [state, setState] = useState<SignInFlow>("signIn");
    <SignInCard setState={setState}/>
     ```
- **If our interface has multiple parameters like**


- ```    
    interface SignInCardprops{
        setState: (state: SignInFlow) => void
        title: string	
    }
    ```
- Then when we call this interface we need to pass both setState and Size params like 

- ```
    <SignInCard title=‚Äùabc‚Äù setState={setState}/>   // Without ‚Äútitle‚Äù it will throw error.
    ```
- **1. Default rule**
- In TypeScript, all props in an interface are required by default.
- ```
    interface MyComponentProps {
    title: string;
    setState: (state: SignInFlow) => void;
    }
```
- If you declare your component:
- ```
    <MyComponent setState={setFlow} />   // ‚ùå Error: "title" is missing
    You must provide both title and setState.
    <MyComponent title=‚Äùabc‚Äù setState={setFlow} />
    ```
 **2. Making a prop optional**
- You can make a prop optional by adding ?:
- ```
    interface MyComponentProps {
    title?: string;
    setState: (state: SignInFlow) => void;
    }   
    ```
Now you can call:
- ```
    <MyComponent setState={setFlow} />   // ‚úÖ title is optional
    ```
Inside the component, title will be of type string | undefined.

**3. Providing a default value**
- ```
    export const MyComponent = ({ title = "Default Title", setState }: MyComponentProps) => {
    return <h1>{title}</h1>;
    };
    ```
- Now:
    ```
    <MyComponent setState={setFlow} />        // ‚úÖ title = "Default Title"
    <MyComponent title="Hello" setState={setFlow} />  // ‚úÖ title = "Hello"
    ```


## Chapter-3: Convex basics
- https://www.convex.dev/
- https://docs.convex.dev/home
- **Add convex to our project**
    - go to our project folder, `bun add convex`
- **Start convex for our project**
    - `bunx convex dev`
    -  if we are not using local convex, It will ask to login and connect to our cloud instance.
    - It will create the convex confis like URL to **.env.local**
    - ```
                ? Welcome to Convex! Would you like to login to your account? Login or create 
        an account
        Welcome to developing with Convex, let's get you logged in.
        ? Device name: Bhakti‚Äôs MacBook Air
        Visit https://auth.convex.dev/device?user_code=DTNH-XLLL to finish logging in.
        You should see the following code which expires in 299 seconds: DTNH-XLLL
        ? Open the browser? Yes
        ‚úî Saved credentials to ~/.convex/config.json
        ? Project name: slack-tutorial
        ‚úî Created project slack-tutorial-5930b, manage it at https://dashboard.convex.dev/t/skyhighdemo58-58/slack-tutorial-5930b
        ‚úî Provisioned a dev deployment and saved its:
            name as CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT to .env.local
            URL as NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL to .env.local

        Write your Convex functions in convex/
        Give us feedback at https://convex.dev/community or support@convex.dev
        View the Convex dashboard at https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/polished-owl-229
   ```
-  Visit our convex data url to check our newly created project.
- Also in our local it wil create a **convex** folder   , will generate generic methods to **query** and **update** the db 
- **Create and add some data to convex table**
- `bunx convex import --table tasks sampleData.jsonl` -> this will take the local jsonl file and create a table by name tasks in convex project.
- **Write a method to query the tasks table**
- Inside convex add tasks.ts
- ```
        import { query } from "./_generated/server";

        export const get = query({
        args: {},
        handler: async (ctx) => {
            return await ctx.db.query("tasks").collect();
        },
        });
   ```
-  This uses the generated query method to fetch the data from convex tasks table.
- **Create a convex-client-provider**  
    - components/convex-client-provider.tsx
- Then we can use it in our page.tsx   
- Add it to layout.tsx SO that this convex-client-provider is available to all pages.

### Understanding next.js App Router Architecture.
- When you chose App Router during project setup, Next.js created a app/ directory‚Äìbased routing system.
- Inside app/, two very special files exist:

    - page.tsx
    - layout.tsx

- They work together to define your UI and how pages share layouts.
- **page.tsx**:
    - Defines a route/page in your app.
    - Each folder inside app/ that contains a page.tsx becomes a route.
- ```
    app/
    ‚îú‚îÄ page.tsx          ‚Üí `/` (home page)
    ‚îú‚îÄ about/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ page.tsx      ‚Üí `/about`
    ‚îî‚îÄ contact/
        ‚îî‚îÄ page.tsx      ‚Üí `/contact`

    ```
- **layout.tsx**:
    - Defines a layout wrapper for pages inside its folder.
    - Layouts are shared across multiple pages.
    - They persist across navigation (unlike pages, which reload).
- ```
        app/
    ‚îú‚îÄ layout.tsx        ‚Üí Root layout (applies to the whole app)
    ‚îú‚îÄ dashboard/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ layout.tsx    ‚Üí Layout for all `/dashboard/*` pages
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ page.tsx      ‚Üí `/dashboard`
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ settings/
    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ page.tsx  ‚Üí `/dashboard/settings`
    ```
- **layout.tsx** must include a children prop to render nested pages:   
- ```
    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
        <body>
            <header>Header (always visible)</header>
            <main>{children}</main>   {/* This is where page.tsx content renders */}
            <footer>Footer (always visible)</footer>
        </body>
        </html>
    );
    }
    ```
    
## Chapter4 - Convex Auth & adding github Authentication
- https://labs.convex.dev/auth/setup
- **Install convex auth library** : `bunx add @convex-dev/auth @auth/core@0.37.0` 
- **Run the initialization command**: `npx @convex-dev/auth`
- This sets up your project for authenticating via the library. This will create files inside convex folder, like `auth.ts` and `http.ts`
- **Now we need to add Auth atables to the schema**
- Add `convex/schema.ts`, here we will add all the tables for authentication.
- ```
    import { defineSchema } from "convex/server";
    import { authTables } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";
    
    const schema = defineSchema({
    ...authTables,
    // Your other tables...
    });
    
    export default schema;
    ```
- `authTables` are the set of table schema definitation precurated for Authentication. 
- If we want to add other tables we need to add them after the authTables. Like below, we are adding tasks table after the authTables, and we are defining the table schema for tasks table by using `defineTable` method.
- ```
        const schema = defineSchema({
    ...authTables,tasks: defineTable({
        isCompleted: v.boolean(),
        text: v.string(),
    }),
    // Your other tables...
    });
    ```
- In last section we have added `ConvexClientProvider` to our layout, so that it was available to all pages. We need to update it to include the authentication. We need to warp our layout with `ConvexAuthNextjsServerProvider`.
- **Add Middleware**
- Nextjs uses `middleware.ts` to handle authentication, we need to add our own middleware to handle authentication.
- ```
        import { 
            convexAuthNextjsMiddleware, 
            createRouteMatcher, 
            nextjsMiddlewareRedirect 
        } from "@convex-dev/auth/nextjs/server";
   ``` 
- **Note**: make sure middleware.ts is inside server folder.
- **Update middleware.ts**: Only make /auth page public, and redirect to home page if user is authenticated.
- **Create Auth route**: Create a new folder `auth` inside app folder, and create a page.tsx file inside it. It will include the `AuthScreen` component.
- Now we can remove `AuthScreen` component from root level `page.tsx` file.
- At this stage, if we access any screen which is not public, it will redirect to /auth page.

### Adding Github Authentication

- **Update auth.ts**: Add github provider to the auth.ts file.
- Enable github authentication in convex. 
- Create a github oAuth app, get the redirect url from convex project settings -> Url & deploy key -> HTTP Actions URL
 and get the client id and client secret.
- ` npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_ID yourgithubclientid`
- ` npx convex env set AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET yourgithubclientsecret`
- After adding this we can see these env variable in convex project settings.-> Environment variables.
- **Note**: if we want to provide these clientId and clientsecret from our code. then we can provide that in auth.ts while initializing the github provider
- ```
        export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store, isAuthenticated } = convexAuth({
    providers: [GitHub({
        clientId: "",
        clientSecret: "",
        })],
    });
    ```
- **Active sign-in button**:
- https://labs.convex.dev/auth/config/oauth#add-sign-in-button
- convex provides a one methiod useAuthActions() -> this return 2 functions signIn and signOut.
- **Update SignInCard component**:
- ```
        const {signIn} = useAuthActions()
    ```
- When login with github button is clicked, it will call signIn function with the provider name (github) as a parameter.
- **when request is already authenticated, user is redirected to the home page:** Update middleware.ts to redirect to home page if user is authenticated.
- **Add a signout button on home page**: use the signOut function of useAuthActions() to sign out the user, add it to home page.
    
- **Note**: Now when we go to any page it will redirect to Signin page, once we click on github Authentication it will redirect to github, once Authenticated it will add that user to user table and other auth info to other auth tables in Convex.

## Chapter 5 - Adding google Authentication
- Create a google oAuth app, get the redirect url from convex project settings -> Url & deploy key -> HTTP Actions URL
- Add the google provider to the auth.ts file.
- In SignInCard component, add google provider signin button, and call signIn function with the provider name (google) as a parameter.
